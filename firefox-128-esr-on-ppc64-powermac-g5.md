Firefox 128-ESR on PPC64 Powermac G5

Since I own the Powermac G5 and play around with it, I want to install a modern
Browser and therefor, I want to run Firefox on it. But it is not possible. I tried
different Linux Distros like Debian 12 PPC64, T2/Linux by Rene Rebe and even
some special builts of ARCH for PPC64 - but I had no luck. No one had luck and 
even the Debian Mailinglist said it is not possible to built Firefox for PPC64
at this time. I even wrote about that.

And now, the other day, I tried [Adelie Linux PPC64](https://www.adelielinux.org/download/) and et voila: I fucking could
start Firefox and tested some Websites like youtube.com and it worked. So I made
a screenshot because I could not believe myself. I totally hope I can use 
Firefox sooner than later on the other Distros too.
