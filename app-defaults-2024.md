App Defaults 2024

Since I installed an RSS-Reader like its 2007, I read my friends again. That's a
thing I am really thankful for. And there, over at pfotenhauers frittiert.es,
I read a [blogpost](https://frittiert.es/articles/2024/11/app-defaults-edition-2024) about **App Defaults**. It's about People who show other people
what they are using for tools 'n apps on a daily base for working and living and in private.

*I will do that, too*.
