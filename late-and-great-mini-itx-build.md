Late and great Mini-ITX Build?

I lastly saw this video about a company who invents Mini-ITX
Cases for PCs, especially for *Gaming PCs*. And I saw this great case [^1]. 
The Case is so neat and everything fits so well. The case is small and can 
stand up to not use too much space on the Desk which I really like. It reminds
me on my *Mac Pro 6,1* - also known as Trashcan - which was an really 
great mini-ITX Computer before it was cool. I would still use one but 
you can't upgrade and therefore it is way much powerconsumption (compared to actual computers) 
for no reason so an actual **Mac Mini M4** is all you need
for everyday computing.

And those M4 Processors are really great, evolving with every new
generation and doing so good in performance and watt consumption. But
there is no graphicscard and the graphic cores are damn slow
compared to nVidia or ATI Cards, even when they also go better and
better. Since Apple Silicon, the company dropped external VGA Support
via Thunderbolt. It is not possible to connect one anymore. And 
will never be again. So this is a big problem for Macs - like ever. If you stuck to **eGPU** Support,
you are bint to macOS / Intel Platform forever.

And beside that this is the reason I want to build a PC in mini-ITX format
just for my pleasure. To game on Windows. **And to run Linux on it**. To crosscompile on it.
Because since a long time, there is no x86 compatible Computer in my house. And now, here is the 
Video. I don't
often mention YouTube-Videos, but that is the reason for this post:

Sadly but there is no seller for this case in germany, I don't know
how to buy it. You can order on the official website of XIKII,
but I have no glue if it works, shipping to europe, germany.
So maybe I need to look for another great mini-ITX Case, there are
plenty of them outside.
