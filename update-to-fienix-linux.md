Update to Fienix Linux

As I wrote in a [few](https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html) 
articles before, I am a big fan of **Fienix Linux** because it works 
absolutely amazing on my Powermac G5, it can even render
complex and modern Websites like my other Weblog (Ghost CMS) and all the big
and modern new Websites.

However, as I continued to use Fienix, I found out that I couldn't 
install any updates or other software packages. After some research, 
I discovered that the *Fienix APT Repo* [was down](https://apfelhammer.de/fieneix-linux-seems-to-be-dead.html). I asked at the corresponding
youtube channel and even at the Website, but there was no answer.

Today, almost by chance, I discovered the official article on the Fienix 
website. The developer writes:

> The Fienix software repository was "unreconciled" due to an unexpected interruption to an update process. Unfortunately, a backup did not exist. Effort to reconcile the repository were unsuccessful. This caused package unavailability, broken packages and broken updates. 

He can't fix it in Version 6 so he hopes to get it fixed with Version 7, what
is months ago. His solution as follows:

> If you have installed all the packages you want/need, you don't need to do anything. Browser updates are generally posted to the "Linux on PowerPC" Facebook group, Hyperion forums, and elsewhere. You can also get packages from Debian, or switch over to Debian completely.

At this point I find it really good that the website, the project and Fienix
Linux itself is not dead, it's has a broken APT Repo and need to be fixed, but
the developer is willing to continue. That gives me hope for my Powermac G5.

**Keep up the great work**
