Claws-Mail 4.3.1 ArchPOWER Linux successfully compiled for PPC64

Due to the lack of a *good graphical email client* [^1] for my Arch POWER Linux 
Distro (Arch Linux for PowerPC), I tried several things and ended up with **claws-mail**. But it is not
installable or not existing in the repos of pacman for powerpc. So I dcided
to compile it by myself.

Claws-Mail 4.3.1 just compiled successfully on my Powermac G5.

Claws Mail is an email client (and news reader), based on GTK+, featuring:

* Quick response
* Graceful, and sophisticated interface
* Easy configuration, intuitive operation
* Abundant features
* Extensibility
* Robustness and stability

Okay, it is an really not beautiful email client, but it works great and we should
not forget my ancient hardware from 2005 :-)

[^1]: I think there is no one. Not only one.
