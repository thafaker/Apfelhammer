I hate it when...

... interesting topics in the internet are videos that *should* be blog posts. 
*I hate it so much*. 
It rises up that every time when I look through the net for a specific topic, I get a
YouTube Video instead of a blog post. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE doing videos
off of clearly to describe topics -  when it is better for the audicence and every other 
people when they write about.

So the audience can easily adopt what the blogger have done instead of a stream of
video (pictures) where one can't copy and paste text or read back again and
again until one understood what they mean - and adapt it well for their needs.

Instead of this you need to watch a fucking video with stupid advertising 
and loud music and bad voice and more bad accoustic and so on.

So please people in the world - do more blog posts or do blog posts for your
videos. But don't do Videos because of the likes and clicks and clickbaiting
when it is better to write about it.

Sincerely,
Jan
