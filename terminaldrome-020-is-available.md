TerminalDrome 0.2.0 is available

I am proud to announce the release of **TerminalDrome** 0.2.0 as a feature-rich
stable version to the public. It is still alpha but it works on a daily basis
here on my Powermac G5 or the Mac Mini M4.

There are [compiled binaries](https://github.com/thafaker/termnavi/releases/tag/v0.2.0) available for arm64, ppc64 and armhf. But TerminalDrome
will build on every Linux with Rust and Cargo.

## Status
* Absolute pre-alpha!!!
* Scrobbling to last.fm and listen.brainz works via Navidrome
* Track updates while playing. Once a song finishes, it automatically switches to the next one and updates the display accordingly.
* A basic full-text search is implemented: press the slash `/` key to open the search window, enter a term, and the results will appear in the third pane.
* Basic Help Screen via Shift+H Button.
* Splash Start Screen :-)
* Nice Status Bar at the bottom
