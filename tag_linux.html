<p>Because there's already a Terminal Navidrome client called NaviTerm, and I don't really like my name TermNavi, I decided to rename my software TerminalDrome. Of course, that sounds completely stupid, but at least it's better than a copy.</p>

<p>I think my software will soon become famous.</p>

<p>Oh, and it doesn't even work properly yet. :-)</p>

<p>So the other day I tried to connect to my <strong>Navidrome</strong> MP3 Streaming Server, 
I call it "Spotify at Home", via Webinterface to listen to some music, but
there were no way to do this. The Webbrowsers available are too old. Sad.</p>

<p>So I decided to programm a really small <em>Navidrome Terminal Client</em> called
TermNavi (yes I know... need better name) to listen to my MP3. And what shall 
I say? The first implementation is ready. I tested and successfully compiled
on aarch64 (my MacMini M4) and the legendary Powermac G5 with ARCH Linux or
Debian Sid ppc64.</p>

<p><img src="images/termnavi.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>So this it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVP for playback</li>
<li>Rust for pgramming</li>
<li>Ratatui f√ºr the Terminal UI (TUI)</li>
<li>a Powermac G5 with PPC Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>Really happy, it is my first rust project. </p>

<h3>known bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>State handling is missing</li>
<li>UI Rendering for more selections</li>
<li>scroll logic is worst</li>
</ul>

<p>And as a now cool hacker guy, I pushed everything in my github repo. But don't
expect too much, I am a worst programmer, I often do not understand what is 
going on and I have everything in one file, the main.rs :-)</p>

<p>In a nice <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/hello-t2linux-2504---i-switched-back-to-1224.html#isso-20">comment from Matias</a>, he told me he is using ArchPOWER Linux, an unofficial
Build of Arch Linux for PowerPC, PPC64, PPC and PPCle for the Power8 Architecture
etc. pp.; If I remember correctly, I stumbled across this Linux Distro while I
researched for the best Linux for my Powermac G5, but maybe because I was at
the beginning of my Linux journey on these machines, I found it to heavy or 
something else told me not to try. I don't know but it is not important anymore,
because I installed ArchPOWER Linux current on my NVMe-SSD in the Powermac, 
multi-booting with T2 Linux, Debian 12 SID, Adelie Linux and Fienix Linux. :-)</p>

<p>As you know my Setup, I will shortly explain again. In my Powermac G5 there is 
an SATA-SSD as a replacement for the old spinning Apple HDD. On this SSD I 
installed Mac OX 10.5 and also Debian SID for PPC, to get the Partition-Scheme
and GRUB installed.</p>

<p>I also built in a NVMe-SSD with 1 TB because the Powermac11,2 has PCI-Express
Slots like it is standard nowadays. The OpenFirmware in the Powermac doesn't 
know what an NVMe-SSD is and therefore can't recognize it or boot it. Also 
Mac OS X 10.5 doesn't <em>see</em> the device. The technic is too young and there are
no drivers, that is the reason for that.</p>

<p>But lucklily, Linux has the drivers for that. And that's the reason for my Setup.
Boot Grub from SSD because that can the Powermac. Than load the things you need
for NVMe and boot the linux off the NVMe-SSD.</p>

<p>I have 4 Linux on that NVMe-SSD and that works great. But it is a problem to 
update the Grub Bootloader everytime there is a new kernerl or something other
changed. Long story short, here I will tell (me) you, how to update grub via chroot.</p>

<p>A lot of crazy things happen right now. A few minutes ago <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/update-to-fienix-linux.html">I reported about the
living sign of Fienix</a> Linux after the APT Repo down and now I see there is a
<a href="https://t2sde.org/#news-2025-04-14">new version of latest and greatest T2 Linux</a> (ver. 25.4) from Rene Rebe. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a total of 17 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl and uClibc combinations are available for 12 CPU ISAs: Alpha, ARM(64), HPPA64, IA64, MIPS64, PowerPC(64), RISCV64, SPARC64, i586, x86-64. On most architectures the release still boots with as little as 512MB of RAM or even less, and ISO downloads are less than 2GB for base Wayland desktop with Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>T2 runs well on my <em>Powermac G5</em>, as I stated <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/new-release-of-t2linux.html">here</a> for detail.</p>

Update to Fienix Linux

<p>As I wrote in a <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html">few</a> 
articles before, I am a big fan of <strong>Fienix Linux</strong> because it works 
absolutely amazing on my Powermac G5, it can even render
complex and modern Websites like my other Weblog (Ghost CMS) and all the big
and modern new Websites.</p>

<p>However, as I continued to use Fienix, I found out that I couldn't 
install any updates or other software packages. After some research, 
I discovered that the <em>Fienix APT Repo</em> <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fieneix-linux-seems-to-be-dead.html">was down</a>. I asked at the corresponding
youtube channel and even at the Website, but there was no answer.</p>

<p>Today, almost by chance, I discovered the official article on the Fienix 
website. The developer writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fienix software repository was "unreconciled" due to an unexpected interruption to an update process. Unfortunately, a backup did not exist. Effort to reconcile the repository were unsuccessful. This caused package unavailability, broken packages and broken updates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He can't fix it in Version 6 so he hopes to get it fixed with Version 7, what
is months ago. His solution as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have installed all the packages you want/need, you don't need to do anything. Browser updates are generally posted to the "Linux on PowerPC" Facebook group, Hyperion forums, and elsewhere. You can also get packages from Debian, or switch over to Debian completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I find it really good that the website, the project and Fienix
Linux itself is not dead, it's has a broken APT Repo and need to be fixed, but
the developer is willing to continue. That gives me hope for my Powermac G5.</p>

<p><strong>Keep up the great work</strong></p>

<p>I find it quite sad because I only recently got to know <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html">Fienix Linux</a>, 
even though it has been around for a long time. And I think it's absolutely 
great because it works better than any other Linux on the Powermac G5 
that I've tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics acceleration</li>
<li>modern web browser</li>
</ul>

<p>But unfortunately the package sources are dead, this Linux is based on Debian 
SID and uses APT. The Fienix source server is unreachable and there is no 
alternative.</p>

<p>I tried to contact the developer, I know that Fienix Linux is a one-man 
project and therefore there are few resources available, but I haven't 
received any response.</p>

<p>So it's not really possible to reinstall packages, I also can't install 
a development environment to compile myself and so it remains nice, but not 
very expandable and usable.</p>

<p>The other day I stumbled across <strong>Fienix Linux</strong>. It is a Distribution maintained by one man,
<em>Casey Cullen</em>. It is based on debian, but with focus on
powerpc first. I just tried to install it on my Powermac G5. And it works great!</p>

<p>There are many different mentions in the web. Some say it is impossible to boot
Powermacs from USB, others says: only PowermacG5 from 7,3 Revision are able to
boot from USB and the third party says: every Powermac is bootable.</p>

<p>And because I own this late and great Powermac G5 11,2 and I don't want to 
always burn a CD/DVD everytime I try a new Linux or something else out, I 
invesitagted a little bit further: the third statement is correct: <em>every Powermac
can boot from USB.</em></p>

<p><strong>But</strong> it is not so easy like we knew it from Intel/x86 Machines. Press a button
and it boots. Because this is
a Powermac with a <em>PowerPC CPU</em> and therefore it uses Open Firmware as an BIOS
alternative. Open Firmware was far ahead of it's time with great features, but
it is a cryptical terminal. :-) So far - so good.</p>

<p>Since I own the Powermac G5 and play around with it, I want to install a modern
Browser and therefor, I want to run Firefox on it. But it is not possible. I tried
different Linux Distros like Debian 12 PPC64, T2/Linux by Rene Rebe and even
some special builts of ARCH for PPC64 - but I had no luck. No one had luck and 
even the Debian Mailinglist said it is not possible to built Firefox for PPC64
at this time. I even wrote about that.</p>

<p>And now, the other day, I tried <a href="https://www.adelielinux.org/download/">Adelie Linux PPC64</a> and et voila: I fucking could
start Firefox and tested some Websites like youtube.com and it worked. So I made
a screenshot because I could not believe myself. I totally hope I can use 
Firefox sooner than later on the other Distros too.</p>

<p>So yesterday was the release ouf <strong>24.12 T2/Linux</strong> and the maintainer, creator
and mastermind behind, Ren√© Rebe, were at a lifestream on youtube and twitch.
So I played around with T2 on my Powermac G5 and listened to the stream and 
had a small chat with him. The most important part is an actual browser on 
that machine so I asked for the actual status of firefox.</p>

<p>Ren√© replied that the problems with big endian still exist and  occours so there is no
Firefox for Big Endian Machines at the moment. Firefox builts well on all little endian
processors, but not on the big ones. There is no better answer at this time,
but I hope he can do something when he have the time. Because to make that
clear: there is not a big audience who is working on big endian ppc64 processors 
like my 970MP is in the world and I believe he get's not enough feedback and 
attention for his work for the open source community. But this is another part.</p>

<p>Debian also faces the problem of <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=firefox&amp;suite=sid">not building firefox for ppc/64</a>, but they have
other important things to do than to fix that. </p>

<p>I know there were patches from oracle for big endian firefox but I cant find 
the repository anymore. Maybe these patches and the Void Patches could do some
important thing? [<strong>UPDATE</strong>] I found the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/tree/master/components/desktop/firefox/patches">patches for firefox</a>.</p>

<p>I bet biggest problem are the people at firefox who doesnt care about big endian
firefox builts for ppc64 because it is not important.</p>

<p>Comments belongs to the website. So I newly established this weblog and I am a great fan of comments. 
Because were is the place to talk about a topic? Directly under the topic, 
right. I now publish with a simple Shell-Script (Bashblog) and there is
no commenting system built in, the author helped out with integrating
Disqus, which is known for being a wideley used commenting hoster. </p>

<p>And there is the point to talk: I think comments belong to the commenters
and to the website were the comments are said, but definitely comments are 
no big data and therefore should not be outsourced to a third-party company 
like disqus is.</p>

<p>And here is the point were <a href="https://isso-comments.de/">isso</a> enters the game. 
Isso is a commenting server similar to Disqus, but were you host your own
data at yourself, on your own server, here at apfelhammer.de</p>

<p>And now I integrated it into my bashblog.</p>

<p>And it is up and running now. </p>

<p>So please feel free to comment:</p>

<ul>
<li>no name needed</li>
<li>no email needed</li>
<li>just your input</li>
</ul>

<p>But because of this, everytime someone is commenting, I'll get an email and have
to moderate the comment. So when you comment, it could take a while, that's
because I am lazy sometimes :-)</p>

<p>Thank you,
Jan</p>
