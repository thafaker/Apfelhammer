Fienix Linux seems to be dead

I find it quite sad because I only recently got to know [Fienix Linux](https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html), 
even though it has been around for a long time. And I think it's absolutely 
great because it works better than any other Linux on the Powermac G5 
that I've tried so far:

* Graphics acceleration
* modern web browser

But unfortunately the package sources are dead, this Linux is based on Debian 
SID and uses APT. The Fienix source server is unreachable and there is no 
alternative.

I tried to contact the developer, I know that Fienix Linux is a one-man 
project and therefore there are few resources available, but I haven't 
received any response.

So it's not really possible to reinstall packages, I also can't install 
a development environment to compile myself and so it remains nice, but not 
very expandable and usable.
