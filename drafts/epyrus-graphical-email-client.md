Epyrus graphical EMail Client

As I recently reported, I was looking for a graphical email client for my 
PowerMac G5. It's currently running Arch Linux for PowerPC, but of course, 
not every package is available. There are various reasons for this, but most 
of them aren't that easy to compile.

I was finally able to compile Claws-Mail without any problems and now use it 
as my email client under XFCE4.

And once again, Matias led me to something, this time it's **Epyrus**. 
Epyrus is a *Thunderbird 52-based* mail client that builds against UXP.
Epyrus development is intended to be similar to Pale Moon development in a 
very broad sense so that it's fairly easy for people who are used to working 
on Pale Moon to start working on this application, and most of the same rules 
and procedures carry over.

So nothing better than that, try to compile epyrus in my powermac for ppc64.
When it's succesfully compile, we have a good looking Thunderbird E-Mail-Client
running fast on our Powermacs. That would be great. But yeah, it is also a game. :-)
