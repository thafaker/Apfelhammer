Apfelhammer.de goes Indieweb

As I mentioned on my [several domains](https://thahipster.de/indieweb-thahipster-de/) before, I am a great fan of the so called
indieweb were you link each other in mentions and talk about topics and you do
this on your domain or your website, not on social media pots were your data and
your stories and thoughts are trapped. Trapped at them. 

So I configured my domain apfelhammer.de as part of the indieweb. I think I can
get webmentions and I am part of the indiewebring.

So you are welcome.

*Byeâ€¦*
