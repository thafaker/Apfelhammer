Release: T2 Linux 25.4 "It Only Does Everything"

A lot of crazy things happen right now. A few minutes ago [I reported about the
living sign of Fienix](https://apfelhammer.de/update-to-fienix-linux.html) Linux after the APT Repo down and now I see there is a
[new version of latest and greatest T2 Linux](https://t2sde.org/#news-2025-04-14) (ver. 25.4) from Rene Rebe. 

> With a total of 17 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl and uClibc combinations are available for 12 CPU ISAs: Alpha, ARM(64), HPPA64, IA64, MIPS64, PowerPC(64), RISCV64, SPARC64, i586, x86-64. On most architectures the release still boots with as little as 512MB of RAM or even less, and ISO downloads are less than 2GB for base Wayland desktop with Firefox.

T2 runs well on my *Powermac G5*, as I stated [here](https://apfelhammer.de/new-release-of-t2linux.html) for detail.
