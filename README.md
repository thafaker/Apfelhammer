apfelhammer.de - a bashblog
========

A single Bash script to create blogs. 

And this is what I use to make https://apfelhammer.de :-) In my weblog I write about how it is to live with an Powermac G5 11,2 on 2025 and how to use it with PPC64 Linux.

I installed different Distros to try out, on an NVMe-SSD

* Arch Linux 
* Debian Sid
* T2/Linux
* Fienix Linux

All of them are working, but with Arch Linux I am most happy actually.

I also wrote a [Terminal Client for Navidrome](https://github.com/thafaker/termnavi), you can find it here.
