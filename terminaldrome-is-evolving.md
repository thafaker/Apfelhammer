TerminalDrome is evolving

My little Terminal Navidrome Project **TerminalDrome** is evolving and works
a little bit better from day to day. So, what is working?

* safes the state of the panes to come back later
* in pane 4 it shows the elapsed time and a small bar is going to 100%
* it plays the songs of an album from 1 to last

What does not work:

* it won't changes the now playing bar when a new song is playing

This is a screenshot of my real Powermac G5 running TerminalDrome in the wild.
