As you all know, I'm a big fan of vintage computers. In addition to an iMac G3, a C64, and an Amiga 500/1200, I also run an MS-DOS PC with Windows 3.11 and networking capabilities. To enable file sharing, I have a small Samba 1 server running.

So it's all the more exciting to see that the fantastic FreeDOS project has released a new version. FreeDOS 1.4 is here.

> FreeDOS is an open source DOS-compatible operating system that you can use to play classic DOS games, run legacy business software, or write new DOS programs. Any program that works on MS-DOS should also run on FreeDOS.

FreeDOS runs on everything, from CD-Rom or USB. FreeDOS 1.4 even includes a floppy-only edition! This edition should run on any original IBM PC system, including the PC, XT, and AT. Provides versions for 720kB, 1.2MB, and 1.44MB floppy disks.
