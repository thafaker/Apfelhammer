As you know, this weblog is about my 2005 [Powermac G5](https://apfelhammer.de/tag_powermacg5.html) and how to use it in 2024
soon 2025 as a normal computing device. I installed different Linux Distros
on an 1 TB NVMe Device while computing with 12 GB-Ram. 

And today reached me the information that famous *René Rebe* did released 
**T2/Linux 12.2024** [1]. They are pleased to announce T2 24.12 as a major update 
with a total of 37 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl 
and uClibc combinations are available for 25 CPU ISAs:
