New Release of TerminalDrome on Github

Since I recently discovered how relaxing programming can be, I've been tinkering with my Navidrome-compatible terminal client called TerminalDrome almost every day.

I've now integrated a new feature, which I've moved to Main:

A simple search function:

* Press slash / and the search will open.
* Enter the search term, press Enter, and you'll see the search results in the right panel.
* It's neither alphabetically sorted nor otherwise organized.
* Additionally, there's a feature in the leftmost panel where you can jump directly to the beginning of the respective artist by pressing a letter of your choice. So if I press D, I'll land on D.A.F., or Q on Queens Of The Stone Ageâ€”you get it?

I'm very proud.

TerminalDrome is written in Rust and can be downloaded and compiled using the following command. You'll need the Rust toolchain and mpv.

	git clone https://github.com/thafaker/termnavi.git TerminalDrome
	cd TerminalDrome
	cargo build && cargo run 

I've also explained this on my [Github repo](https://github.com/thafaker/termnavi/tree/main).
