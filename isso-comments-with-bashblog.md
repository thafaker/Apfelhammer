ISSO Comments with Bashblog

Comments belongs to the website. So I newly established this weblog and I am a great fan of comments. 
Because were is the place to talk about a topic? Directly under the topic, 
right. I now publish with a simple Shell-Script (Bashblog) and there is
no commenting system built in, the author helped out with integrating
Disqus, which is known for being a wideley used commenting hoster. 

And there is the point to talk: I think comments belong to the commenters
and to the website were the comments are said, but definitely comments are 
no big data and therefore should not be outsourced to a third-party company 
like disqus is.

And here is the point were [isso](https://isso-comments.de/) enters the game. 
Isso is a commenting server similar to Disqus, but were you host your own
data at yourself, on your own server, here at apfelhammer.de

And now I integrated it into my bashblog.

And it is up and running now. 

So please feel free to comment:

* no name needed
* no email needed
* just your input

But because of this, everytime someone is commenting, I'll get an email and have
to moderate the comment. So when you comment, it could take a while, that's
because I am lazy sometimes :-)

Thank you,
Jan
