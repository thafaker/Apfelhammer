Mac OS X 10.5.8 with modern Browser

As you can see in the screenshot, I am visiting both my weblog and amazon.de
Websites with the Powermac G5 2,0 GHz. This is only possible because there
is a relative modern webbrowser (2022) by user wicknix, built upon **TenFourFox**.

So with this webbrowser the old 20 years old Powermac is able to visit modern
websites like Amazon. No, I dont like amazon, but is is an example. Youtube
also works, but loads a lot longer.

With this browser it is possible to use the mac in a day to day modern web world,
but slow. I can even access webmails, read yahoo news or something like that
while chatting via *colloguy* and telnetting into my server.

Really sad to read this:

Another good one is gone, but wicknix do have his reasons I bet.
