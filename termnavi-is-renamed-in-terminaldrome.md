TermNavi is renamed in TerminalDrome

Because there's already a Terminal Navidrome client called NaviTerm, and I don't really like my name TermNavi, I decided to rename my software TerminalDrome. Of course, that sounds completely stupid, but at least it's better than a copy.

I think my software will soon become famous.

Oh, and it doesn't even work properly yet. :-)
