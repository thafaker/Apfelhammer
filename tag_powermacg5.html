<p>So the other day I tried to connect to my <strong>Navidrome</strong> MP3 Streaming Server, 
I call it "Spotify at Home", via Webinterface to listen to some music, but
there were no way to do this. The Webbrowsers available are too old. Sad.</p>

<p>So I decided to programm a really small <em>Navidrome Terminal Client</em> called
TermNavi (yes I know... need better name) to listen to my MP3. And what shall 
I say? The first implementation is ready. I tested and successfully compiled
on aarch64 (my MacMini M4) and the legendary Powermac G5 with ARCH Linux or
Debian Sid ppc64.</p>

<p><img src="images/termnavi.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>So this it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVP for playback</li>
<li>Rust for pgramming</li>
<li>Ratatui f√ºr the Terminal UI (TUI)</li>
<li>a Powermac G5 with PPC Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>Really happy, it is my first rust project. </p>

<h3>known bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>State handling is missing</li>
<li>UI Rendering for more selections</li>
<li>scroll logic is worst</li>
</ul>

<p>And as a now cool hacker guy, I pushed everything in my github repo. But don't
expect too much, I am a worst programmer, I often do not understand what is 
going on and I have everything in one file, the main.rs :-)</p>

<p>Due to the lack of a <em>good graphical email client</em> [^1] for my Arch POWER Linux 
Distro (Arch Linux for PowerPC), I tried several things and ended up with <strong>claws-mail</strong>. But it is not
installable or not existing in the repos of pacman for powerpc. So I dcided
to compile it by myself.</p>

<p>Claws-Mail 4.3.1 just compiled successfully on my Powermac G5.</p>

<p><img src="/images/claws-mail_start.jpg" alt="" title="" />
<small>claws-mail first window, first start</small></p>

<p>Claws Mail is an email client (and news reader), based on GTK+, featuring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quick response</li>
<li>Graceful, and sophisticated interface</li>
<li>Easy configuration, intuitive operation</li>
<li>Abundant features</li>
<li>Extensibility</li>
<li>Robustness and stability</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/screen_grab_claws.png" alt="" title="" />
<small>todays screenshot of my inbox on claws-mail on my powermac g5</small></p>

<p>Okay, it is an really not beautiful email client, but it works great and we should
not forget my ancient hardware from 2005 :-)</p>

<p>[^1]: I think there is no one. Not only one.</p>

<p>In a nice <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/hello-t2linux-2504---i-switched-back-to-1224.html#isso-20">comment from Matias</a>, he told me he is using ArchPOWER Linux, an unofficial
Build of Arch Linux for PowerPC, PPC64, PPC and PPCle for the Power8 Architecture
etc. pp.; If I remember correctly, I stumbled across this Linux Distro while I
researched for the best Linux for my Powermac G5, but maybe because I was at
the beginning of my Linux journey on these machines, I found it to heavy or 
something else told me not to try. I don't know but it is not important anymore,
because I installed ArchPOWER Linux current on my NVMe-SSD in the Powermac, 
multi-booting with T2 Linux, Debian 12 SID, Adelie Linux and Fienix Linux. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Man</strong>, I am a little bit frustrated right now. Everytime a new release of 
<a href="https://apfelhammer.de/release-t2-linux-254-it-only-does-everything.html">T2/Linux</a>
is going online, I am really happy to try it out on my <em>Powermac G5</em>. I download
it and <code>dd</code> it to a USB Stick (<a href="https://apfelhammer.de/how-to-boot-powermac-from-usb.html">here</a> 
I explain how to boot a PPC Mac from USB) and than boot the Powermac via OpenFirmware
from that USB Stick and everything works like charme. Like I exspect it.</p>

<p>The Install Process is straight forward and easy, thanks to <em>STONE</em>, the Installer
of T2. But with Version 25.04 there is a problem, the FANs turn to MAX rotation like
there is a kernel module not loaded or something like that and you think the G5 
will soon fly away. The next thing: X seems to be broken, I can't <code>startx</code> 
anymore. </p>

<p>In <strong>24.12</strong> these things were okay, X works and even 3D-Acceleration works 
so I could use it in a quite usual way. But now - <em>all of this is gone</em>. 
Everytime I try, there is another problem. Something other broken. 
And I am not smart enough to fix it. I do not understand enough and there is
not enough documentation to get this done. Sure, Ren√© is a One-Man-Show with his
T2 Linux Project and he is fixing a lot of older drivers and software packages
and he earns nothing and I say thank you man. Great Job. But even in his 
documentation, I am unable to find the right solution e.g. to crosscompile not the 
whole target, just a package and all of it's depencies.</p>

<p>I never got <em>Palemoon</em> or <em>ArcticFox</em> compiled or crosscompiled, because there
are errors I canot solve. I installed <strong>T2/ARM64</strong> on my <em>Mac Mini M4</em> because this
small machine is really powerful so it is a great crosscompoling solution for
the me at home for my PPC64 Powermac. 
But it starts while compiling gcc. I am unable to compile GCC. And 
without GCC there is no way to compile anything further.</p>

<p>As you know my Setup, I will shortly explain again. In my Powermac G5 there is 
an SATA-SSD as a replacement for the old spinning Apple HDD. On this SSD I 
installed Mac OX 10.5 and also Debian SID for PPC, to get the Partition-Scheme
and GRUB installed.</p>

<p>I also built in a NVMe-SSD with 1 TB because the Powermac11,2 has PCI-Express
Slots like it is standard nowadays. The OpenFirmware in the Powermac doesn't 
know what an NVMe-SSD is and therefore can't recognize it or boot it. Also 
Mac OS X 10.5 doesn't <em>see</em> the device. The technic is too young and there are
no drivers, that is the reason for that.</p>

<p>But lucklily, Linux has the drivers for that. And that's the reason for my Setup.
Boot Grub from SSD because that can the Powermac. Than load the things you need
for NVMe and boot the linux off the NVMe-SSD.</p>

<p>I have 4 Linux on that NVMe-SSD and that works great. But it is a problem to 
update the Grub Bootloader everytime there is a new kernerl or something other
changed. Long story short, here I will tell (me) you, how to update grub via chroot.</p>

<p>A lot of crazy things happen right now. A few minutes ago <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/update-to-fienix-linux.html">I reported about the
living sign of Fienix</a> Linux after the APT Repo down and now I see there is a
<a href="https://t2sde.org/#news-2025-04-14">new version of latest and greatest T2 Linux</a> (ver. 25.4) from Rene Rebe. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a total of 17 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl and uClibc combinations are available for 12 CPU ISAs: Alpha, ARM(64), HPPA64, IA64, MIPS64, PowerPC(64), RISCV64, SPARC64, i586, x86-64. On most architectures the release still boots with as little as 512MB of RAM or even less, and ISO downloads are less than 2GB for base Wayland desktop with Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>T2 runs well on my <em>Powermac G5</em>, as I stated <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/new-release-of-t2linux.html">here</a> for detail.</p>

Update to Fienix Linux

<p>As I wrote in a <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html">few</a> 
articles before, I am a big fan of <strong>Fienix Linux</strong> because it works 
absolutely amazing on my Powermac G5, it can even render
complex and modern Websites like my other Weblog (Ghost CMS) and all the big
and modern new Websites.</p>

<p>However, as I continued to use Fienix, I found out that I couldn't 
install any updates or other software packages. After some research, 
I discovered that the <em>Fienix APT Repo</em> <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fieneix-linux-seems-to-be-dead.html">was down</a>. I asked at the corresponding
youtube channel and even at the Website, but there was no answer.</p>

<p>Today, almost by chance, I discovered the official article on the Fienix 
website. The developer writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fienix software repository was "unreconciled" due to an unexpected interruption to an update process. Unfortunately, a backup did not exist. Effort to reconcile the repository were unsuccessful. This caused package unavailability, broken packages and broken updates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He can't fix it in Version 6 so he hopes to get it fixed with Version 7, what
is months ago. His solution as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have installed all the packages you want/need, you don't need to do anything. Browser updates are generally posted to the "Linux on PowerPC" Facebook group, Hyperion forums, and elsewhere. You can also get packages from Debian, or switch over to Debian completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I find it really good that the website, the project and Fienix
Linux itself is not dead, it's has a broken APT Repo and need to be fixed, but
the developer is willing to continue. That gives me hope for my Powermac G5.</p>

<p><strong>Keep up the great work</strong></p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, I am visiting both my weblog and amazon.de
Websites with the Powermac G5 2,0 GHz. This is only possible because there
is a relative modern webbrowser (2022) by user wicknix, built upon <strong>TenFourFox</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="images/interweb.png"><img src="images/interweb.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
<small>InterWebPPC: Mozilla for Power Macintosh</small></p>

<p>So with this webbrowser the old 20 years old Powermac is able to visit modern
websites like Amazon. No, I dont like amazon, but is is an example. Youtube
also works, but loads a lot longer.</p>

<p>With this browser it is possible to use the mac in a day to day modern web world,
but slow. I can even access webmails, read yahoo news or something like that
while chatting via <em>colloguy</em> and telnetting into my server.</p>

<p>Really sad to read this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This repository has been archived by the owner on Jul 26, 2023. It is now read-only.</p>

<p>Another good one is gone, but wicknix do have his reasons I bet.</p>

<p>I find it quite sad because I only recently got to know <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/fienix-linux-for-ppc-computers.html">Fienix Linux</a>, 
even though it has been around for a long time. And I think it's absolutely 
great because it works better than any other Linux on the Powermac G5 
that I've tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics acceleration</li>
<li>modern web browser</li>
</ul>

<p>But unfortunately the package sources are dead, this Linux is based on Debian 
SID and uses APT. The Fienix source server is unreachable and there is no 
alternative.</p>

<p>I tried to contact the developer, I know that Fienix Linux is a one-man 
project and therefore there are few resources available, but I haven't 
received any response.</p>

<p>So it's not really possible to reinstall packages, I also can't install 
a development environment to compile myself and so it remains nice, but not 
very expandable and usable.</p>

<p>And because I own this late and great Powermac G5 11,2 and I don't want to 
always burn a CD/DVD everytime I try a new Linux or something else out, I 
invesitagted a little bit further: the third statement is correct: <em>every Powermac
can boot from USB.</em></p>

<p><strong>But</strong> it is not so easy like we knew it from Intel/x86 Machines. Press a button
and it boots. Because this is
a Powermac with a <em>PowerPC CPU</em> and therefore it uses Open Firmware as an BIOS
alternative. Open Firmware was far ahead of it's time with great features, but
it is a cryptical terminal. :-) So far - so good.</p>

<p>Since I own the Powermac G5 and play around with it, I want to install a modern
Browser and therefor, I want to run Firefox on it. But it is not possible. I tried
different Linux Distros like Debian 12 PPC64, T2/Linux by Rene Rebe and even
some special builts of ARCH for PPC64 - but I had no luck. No one had luck and 
even the Debian Mailinglist said it is not possible to built Firefox for PPC64
at this time. I even wrote about that.</p>

<p>And now, the other day, I tried <a href="https://www.adelielinux.org/download/">Adelie Linux PPC64</a> and et voila: I fucking could
start Firefox and tested some Websites like youtube.com and it worked. So I made
a screenshot because I could not believe myself. I totally hope I can use 
Firefox sooner than later on the other Distros too.</p>

<p>There is always the discussion around if the Powermacs are able to boot from USB or 
not and I can say: every Powermac G5 is able to boot from USB Thumbdrive. So it
is quite easy to dd an ISO of Linux or Leopard to an USB-Drive and boot-up the
Powermac G5 with it. But also older Macs. Older Roms. Older Edlers.

<p>There are quite a few Powermac Enthusiast around the world, like I am. They are
using the Powermac G5 for day-to-day work and I think this is pretty cool,
even when I think we need to go green as fast as possible in the reason of
power consumption, I will give it a try. My G5 doesnt need more than 250 Watts
even with the Cinema HD 23" Display in use.</p>

<p><img src="images/sorbet.png" alt="sorbet.png" title="" /></p>

<p>magine if Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released for the PowerPC architecture. Aging machines would have received a much-needed boost in performance, software updates would have carried on for a little bit further, and instrumental features would have been newly claimed -- resulting in pre-existing hardware being kept in service for much longer.</p>

<p>While Apple opted not to continue the development of Snow Leopard for PowerPC-based Macs, that did not stop dedicated communities from filling this void (and then some) over a decade later. Enter Sorbet Leopard, a fresh new release of Mac OS X designed exclusively for the venerable Power Macintosh, fifteen years after the final model was sold.</p>

<p>Built off of the rock-solid Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard base system, Mac OS X 10.5.9 Sorbet Leopard offers a significant jump in speed and security over its predecessor by utilizing advanced methods of performance optimization, system streamlining, and brand new features, all together rivaling most of the UX improvements seen in Snow Leopard on Intel machines.</p>

<p>Thanks to the over 70 new changes present in Mac OS X 10.5.9, here's what to expect once installed ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Faster startup times, application launch times, and network performance</li>
<li>Smoother, more fluid, and more consistent UI animations</li>
<li>A brand new app store tailored for only the best apps on Mac OS X 10.5.x</li>
<li>Built-in tools to create RAM disks, run routine maintenance, configure hidden preferences, toggle background services, and more</li>
<li>Full compatibility with the Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse</li>
<li>Full compatibility with Unicode 13.1 emoji characters</li>
<li>Updated desktop pictures, user pictures, screen savers, fonts, and Apple dictionaries, alongside apps such as Dashboard 1.7, Expos√© 1.1, Front Row 1.1, Spaces 1.1, Time Machine 1.1, Java Preferences 13.9.8, and System Profiler 10.6.0, all from the final release of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</li>
<li>Comprehensive system themes inline with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, macOS 10.13 High Sierra, and iOS 4 to 12, featuring authentic desktop pictures, user pictures, screen savers, and UI assets unique to each choice</li>
<li>Updated security certificates inline with macOS 10.13 High Sierra</li>
<li>Updated applications including Safari 11 with new security updates and performance improvements, QuickTime 7.7 Pro, Bash 4.3.30, and ntpd 4.2.8</li>
<li>Integrated optimizations such as reduced disk activity, reduced CPU / RAM / disk usage, PowerPC-optimized binaries, and universal ad blocking</li>
</ul>

Status of Firefox on PPC64 Big Endian

<p>So yesterday was the release ouf <strong>24.12 T2/Linux</strong> and the maintainer, creator
and mastermind behind, Ren√© Rebe, were at a lifestream on youtube and twitch.
So I played around with T2 on my Powermac G5 and listened to the stream and 
had a small chat with him. The most important part is an actual browser on 
that machine so I asked for the actual status of firefox.</p>

<p>Ren√© replied that the problems with big endian still exist and  occours so there is no
Firefox for Big Endian Machines at the moment. Firefox builts well on all little endian
processors, but not on the big ones. There is no better answer at this time,
but I hope he can do something when he have the time. Because to make that
clear: there is not a big audience who is working on big endian ppc64 processors 
like my 970MP is in the world and I believe he get's not enough feedback and 
attention for his work for the open source community. But this is another part.</p>

<p>Debian also faces the problem of <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=firefox&amp;suite=sid">not building firefox for ppc/64</a>, but they have
other important things to do than to fix that. </p>

<p>I know there were patches from oracle for big endian firefox but I cant find 
the repository anymore. Maybe these patches and the Void Patches could do some
important thing? [<strong>UPDATE</strong>] I found the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/tree/master/components/desktop/firefox/patches">patches for firefox</a>.</p>

<p>I bet biggest problem are the people at firefox who doesnt care about big endian
firefox builts for ppc64 because it is not important.</p>

<p>As you know, this weblog is about my 2005 <a href="https://apfelhammer.de/tag_powermacg5.html">Powermac G5</a> and how to use it in 2024
soon 2025 as a normal computing device. I installed different Linux Distros
on an 1 TB NVMe Device while computing with 12 GB-Ram. </p>

<p>And today reached me the information that famous <em>Ren√© Rebe</em> did released 
<strong>T2/Linux 12.2024</strong> [1]. They are pleased to announce T2 24.12 as a major update 
with a total of 37 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl

<p>I plugged in that great <strong>NVMe SSD</strong> into my Powermac G5 because he supports PCI-Express (Version 1.0) and
there is a 4x Speed Port that is unused (the x16 is for the Graphicscard) and now I ran a 1 TB NVMe-SSD
in this Powermac and it is doing great. Because due the lack of drivers, Open Firmware is unable to
boot from thos NVMe-SSDs, he is able to boot from a normal 2,5" SSD on the SATA-Port. So I installed the
/boot/grub parts to that SSD and therefor it loads the Operating System from the NVMe :-) This is
working quite well and I run </p>

<ul>
<li>Debian 12</li>
<li>T2/SDE Linux</li>
<li>Ad√©lie Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>for PowerPC 64 PPC64 plattform. I even write this article on that machine while on Debian 12 doing an
<code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code>, running SeaLion Firefox and listening to music. Okay, it is not the 
performance of a late and great 128 Core Threadripper, but it is quite impressive what this machine
from 2005 is able to do in the end of 2024.</p>

<p><code>powermac:~$ uname -a <br />
Linux powermac 6.12.5-powerpc64 #1 SMP Debian 6.12.5-1 (2024-12-15) ppc64 GNU/Linux</code></p>

<p>I installed 12 GB-Ram and that NVMe-SSD in the System. It has a 2 GHz PPC970MP Dualcore CPU and
the original Apple 23" Cinema Display. I like that setup, typing is done via the famous Keycron K2
Keyboard.</p>

<p>Actually, I have no glue what can I do to get things crosscompiled. Firefox for PowerPC is broken and
epiphany is running with a white screen, doesnt load on Debian. There is no 
actual browser for PowerPC, what I really dislike. 
I now use SeaLion (Version 33.4) and it is surprisingly good, even github loads and a 
lot of other new websites. It is usable.</p>
